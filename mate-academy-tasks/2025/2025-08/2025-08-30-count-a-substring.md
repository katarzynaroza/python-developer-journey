# 📝 Task - Create a function count_substring() that:

Takes the string sentence and the substring substring. Returns the number of times the substring appears in the sentence.  
<pre>
def count_substring(sentence: str, substring: str) -> int:
    substring_number = sentence.count(substring)
    return(substring_number)
</pre>

# 💭 Technical reflection: 
- sometimes it is good to have a small break, it is also good to have deep focus :)
