# ✅ Daily Update Checklist

Use this checklist to stay consistent and intentional — without overwhelming your learning time.

## 🗓️ Every Day (15–20 min max)

- [ ] 📚 **Update notes in the current module folder**  
  _Main place for documenting what you learned today (e.g. `03_python_extended/`)_

- [ ] 🗒️ **Add a short reflection at the end of module notes**  
  _1–2 sentences: What clicked today? What was hard?_

- [ ] 🐞 **Log bugs or issues (only if relevant)**  
  _Update `bugfix_log.md` if you debugged something_

- [ ] 💡 **Add new mentor questions (if any)**  
  _Update `mentor_questions.md` only when something puzzles you_

## 🌱 Weekly (e.g. every Friday)

- [ ] 🌱 **Reflect on Gallup talents**  
  _Did you use any strengths this week? Add to `gallup_reflections.md`_

- [ ] 🧠 **Update Glossary**  
  _Add new terms from the week to `glossary.md`_

- [ ] 🧾 **Create or update cheat sheets**  
  _Only if you learned something reusable or worth summarizing_

💡 **Tip:** You can merge your daily reflection directly into your module notes like this:

Today I practiced understanding lists. At first they were unintuitive, but after a few examples I started to understand them.
