# My Python Journal – A Backend Developer's Journey Powered by Gallup Talents

This repository documents my personal journey of becoming a backend developer with Python, Django, and REST APIs — guided not only by technical milestones, but also by my unique strengths and personality.

As a **melancholic virtuoso (ISTP)** with Gallup talents in:
- 🔧 **Restorative (Naprawianie)** – solving problems and debugging with persistence  
- 🤝 **Harmony (Zgodność)** – fostering clarity and calm in communication  
- 🧭 **Responsibility (Odpowiedzialność)** – staying consistent and committed to growth  
- 🌱 **Developer (Rozwijanie innych)** – sharing knowledge and supporting others  
- 🔗 **Connectedness (Współzależność)** – seeing patterns, relationships, and the bigger picture in systems  

I approach learning with depth, structure, and a desire to grow through reflection and contribution.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- 🧠 Daily journals and debugging diaries  
- 🗺️ Weekly summaries aligned with my talents  
- 🛠️ Projects and exercises from my Mate Academy course  
- 🌱 Reflections on emotional and cognitive growth  
- 📍 My full learning roadmap and daily rhythm [here](roadmap.md)

This is more than a coding repo — it's a map of how I learn, solve problems, and evolve as a developer and a person.

## 🧭 Productivity System Overview

To stay consistent and avoid overwhelm, I follow a structured but flexible rhythm:

### 🔹 Weekly Planning
- I update my [roadmap](roadmap.md) every Sunday  
- I reflect in `weekly-summary.md` using prompts based on my Gallup talents  
- I set 3–5 realistic goals for the week

### 🔹 Daily Practice
- I focus on theory and coding (core blocks)  
- I optionally reflect, plan, or update GitHub (support blocks)  
- I document errors in `debug-diary.md` and thoughts in `journal.md`

> I don’t aim for perfection — I aim for rhythm. I allow myself to adapt, reflect, and grow at my own pace.
