# 🌱 Gallup Talent Development Plan – Python Developer Journey

This file helps me intentionally develop my Gallup strengths during the course.  
It’s designed for solo learning, with weekly reflections and daily micro-practices.

---

## 🔧 Restorative

I enjoy solving problems and fixing broken things — especially in code.

**Weekly Focus:**
- Practice debugging and testing
- Keep a bugfix log: what went wrong, how I solved it
- Go deeper than “just fix it” — understand the root cause

**Daily Micro-Practices:**
- Analyze one bug in depth
- Write down what I learned from fixing it
- Reflect: Did I feel energized by solving this?

---

## 🤝 Harmony

I value clarity, calm, and constructive communication — even with myself.

**Weekly Focus:**
- Practice writing clear README files and code comments
- Give myself kind, useful feedback
- Choose solutions that feel balanced and sustainable

**Daily Micro-Practices:**
- Ask: “Is this solution clear and respectful — even to future me?”
- Rephrase one note or comment to make it more constructive
- Reflect: Did I avoid unnecessary stress today?

---

## 🌱 Developer (solo version)

I grow by creating, documenting, and sharing — even if it’s just for myself.

**Weekly Focus:**
- Create notes, cheat sheets, and checklists
- Document my learning in ways that help future me
- Share solutions publicly (GitHub, blog, portfolio)

**Daily Micro-Practices:**
- Write down one thing I wish I’d known last week
- Create a micro-resource: comment, diagram, note, or snippet
- Reflect: Did I build something that shows growth?

---

## 🔗 Connectedness

I see how things fit together — and I learn best when I understand the system.

**Weekly Focus:**
- Explore how different parts of an app connect
- Learn system architecture and dependencies
- Think about how my work affects the whole

**Daily Micro-Practices:**
- Ask: “How does this piece of code affect the rest?”
- Create a diagram or mind map of relationships
- Reflect: Did I notice a pattern or connection today?

---

## 🧭 Responsibility

I take ownership of my learning and follow through on my commitments.

**Weekly Focus:**
- Plan tasks and track progress
- Set realistic goals and stick to them
- Communicate clearly — even in documentation

**Daily Micro-Practices:**
- Plan my learning session and review it afterward
- Write down one commitment and follow through
- Reflect: Did I act with integrity today?
