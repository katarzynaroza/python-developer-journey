# 🧠 Weekly Reflections – How I Track My Growth

This folder contains my weekly documentation of learning, emotions, and progress as a backend developer.

## 📁 Structure

- `2025/` → year folders  
  - `08/week-01/` → daily journal, debug diary, weekly summary  
- `templates/` → reusable templates for each file  
- `mentor-questions.md` → optional notes from mentor conversations

## 🗓️ How I Use It

### 🔹 Daily
- Fill out `journal.md` (5–10 min)  
- Update `debug-diary.md` if a bug or challenge occurred (10 min)

### 🔹 Weekly
- Write `weekly-summary.md` (30 min)  
- Reflect using Gallup talents  
- Link to key commits or lessons

### 🔹 Templates
Reusable formats are stored in [`templates/`](templates/)  
I copy them into each new week folder as needed.
