### 💡 Co mnie zaskoczyło / zaciekawiło?
- I should remember, not to add int + str :)

---

### 🧠 Czego się nauczyłam?
- PDB (import pdb) i.e. python debugger, use to stop a program in chosen line [see the code in my mate-academy-tasks](https://github.com/katarzynaroza/python-developer-journey/blob/main/mate-academy-tasks/2025/2025_08_14_PDB_debugging.md)

- Debugger PyCharm: how to create intuitiv breakpoint, to "stop" a program in good to me place. It helps ind debugging (click for number of line - it becomes 
a red point, - thanks that, when I click "play", the error still exist, but when I click a bug (a button near play), I can see the TYPES and VALUES of variables (that are 
till the line with red point).
- button "RESUME PROGRAM" (in debug console) helps iterate to the next loop position, and than I can see what happen's in next line of program, and then the value of variable 
is different.
- button "console" (still in debug console) - i can write there commands, like number (the console shows value), type(number), etc,
- STOP AND RERUN bug button in right upper corner - helps to rerun breaking/ stopping a program
- STEP INTO (button) helps to go to next line even if the breakpoint is still in the same place (f.i.I can see, what values takes next line - below the brakepoint - in the same iteration
of a loop)

### 🧩 Co było trudne / co chcę powtórzyć?
GitHub definitely tested my patience today 😅.
On the bright side, I now understand tags, repo structure and links much better — future journal entries will be way quicker to put together.

### 🔖 Tagi / tematy:
`TAG: PYTHON | TAG: DEBUGGING`

### 🧘‍♀️ Refleksja (opcjonalnie):
I see, it's good to write in english (I learn new words) and it's good to makre exercises from movies in Mate Academy also in PyCharm - i can see, what I understand and what not.
