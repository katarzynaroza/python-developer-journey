### 🔍 Co dziś zrobiłam?
Even though I haven't made any progress in the sense of "solving the problem," I feel like even trying to analyze the problem is already making a difference—I'm learning patience, reading the content carefully, and breaking down problems into smaller steps. In the coming days, I want to spend more time on these more challenging topics and improve my skills step by step.
