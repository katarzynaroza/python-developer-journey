## 🗓️ Weekly Summary — 2025-08-13 to 2025-08-16

### 🔧 RESTORATIVE – rozwiązywanie problemów
- A job with GitHub was a little bit dificult, but I ask Chat GPT for help and I will ask my mentor about my reposit
- When I start to use PyCharm debugger it was frustrating, to start to use it. I used Chat GPT, but still I needed a lot of time to get the answear. Maybe next time, in small things I will ask my mentor about them (during the week).

### 🌱 DEVELOPER – rozwój innych i siebie
- In a faster way I can use links and tags in GitHub.

### 🎯 Cele na przyszły tydzień:
- make more excersises from my course of Python
- it is better (if I have such possibility) to practice Python from the begging of the day (not in the evening).
- repeat information after studies, before a dream, and next day before the lesson (by looking for informations in my memory).
- turn off my mobile, during studies.
- turn on timer (for 45minutes to learn and have some breaks).
- ask my family not to talk to me during studies.
- remember about my motivation - job from home, working with subject, in witch I am good, job with one task in time.
- template of the day with AI: ask it to sort my task per a day with Eisenhower matrix (urgent, not urgent, important, unimportant): 
<pre><pre> a) Important and urgent – do it now; </pre></pre>
<pre><pre> b) Important but not urgent – schedule it;</pre></pre>
<pre><pre> c) Urgent but not important – delegate it to someone else or limit it;</pre></pre>
<pre><pre> d) Neither urgent nor important – cross it out without remorse.</pre></pre>
- batching method in planning a day (not dishwashing during studing) - use deep focus. Limit switching between contexts.
- stay flexible:  
Having a bad day? Tired, stressed? It's normal. In times like these:  
  
<pre><pre>Review previous materials.</pre></pre>
<pre><pre>Do something simpler that you already know.</pre></pre>
<pre><pre>Join the Q&A, even if just for inspiration.</pre></pre>
<pre><pre>📈 Remember: slow progress is still progress.</pre></pre>
