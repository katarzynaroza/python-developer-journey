### 🔍 What have I done today?
I have read about min() function, about using NaN in code and I have done some tasks about that.

### 💡 What surprised/interested me?
Python can process big number without overflow error or without loss of precision, but big numbers need big amount of RAM. Furthermore, it's good to write a code in such way, not to waste a time. F.i. sometimes sth. can be out of loop, not to make some step. Thanks that, code and program is quicker. Whats more, conditions, that check edge cases (f.i. wheter wariable is empty or = 0) it is good to be at the beginning, than if the edge cases are met, Python end at the beginning of program, doesn't check other cases.

### 🧠 What I learned?
Min() funtion can show not only minimal value of parameters, but can show also what if the parametr is empty. As for NaN, I have to import that at the beggining of code, the parameter is then float("nan"). If I would ask Python to return float("nan"), the result wil be "NaN". [Here You can see an example of using Nan.](https://github.com/katarzynaroza/python-developer-journey/blob/main/mate-academy-tasks/2025/2025-08-24-NaN-if-no-water.md)

### 😊 What made me happy/satisfied?
I now, I should do a refactoring and my code is more clear and faster.
